# Reverse-TCP


      This C++ Reverse Handler is designed to establish a secure and confidential communication channel with a remote server. 
The program starts by initializing a socket and initiating a secure SSL handshake with the server. 
Once the SSL connection is established, the program reads data from the socket and performs encryption and decryption operations on the data.
To ensure maximum security, the program uses custom encryption and decryption logic that can be tailored to the specific encryption algorithm of your choice. 
The SSL_read() and SSL_write() functions are utilized to securely read and write data over the SSL channel.
The program then sends the encrypted data back to the remote server over the SSL connection.
The SSL connection ensures that the data remains secure and confidential during transmission, making it an ideal solution for sensitive data communication.
